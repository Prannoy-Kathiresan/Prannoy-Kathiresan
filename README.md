Hi there, I'm Prannoy! ðŸ‘‹

To give a brief bio about me, I am an Industrial and Systems Engineering graduate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), specializing in Data Science and Operations Research. As part of my coursework, I have successfully completed courses in Algorithms, Statistics, Linear Programming, Analysis of Network Data, Machine Learning, Database Systems, Deep Learning, Data Visualization, Big Data, Clustering, and Systems Optimization.

I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of numerical analysis, statistics, operations research, engineering, and machine learning, deriving actionable insights to inform decision-making. I have a strong academic background in engineering with an aptitude for mathematics, having completed my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering.

Regarding my personal capabilities, I believe my strength lies in getting tasks done efficiently, even in unfamiliar situations. I have 2.5 years of professional work experience at MRF Tyres, a leading tire manufacturer in India. Additionally, I have served as a graduate teaching assistant for 1.5 years as a fully funded student, covering diverse fields such as bioengineering, finance, and computer engineering. Currently, I am serving as a graduate research assistant at UIUC.
